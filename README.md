# Introduction

This project is a little website to plan pizza parties.
It makes some calculation to determine whether or not a pizza order will be fair to every diet present at the party.
This website is live at
https://pizza-party-maker.bertrand-baudeur.fr

This project is a vite react frontend only website.
It is written in typecript, and deployable with docker.
It uses little to no component library, because it's a project created to learn React.

## Why did I make this?

I made this website for two main reason.
The first one is that I personnally needed it.
I'm vegetarian, and a few times in my life I had to plan pizza parties, meaning, a party in which the food supply is a buffet of non assigned pizzas.
And when I did so, my first approach was to order the same proportion of vegetarian pizza as the proportion of vegetarian persons in the party.
And I quickly realized that I often was completely out of vegetarian pizza way before all pizzas were depleted.
It made sense afterward, vegetarian pizza (such as the 4 cheese for example) are absolutely not exclusive to vegetarians. Hence they are divided among more people than the other pizza so they are depleted faster.
So I started to do some calculation in excel, very simple, inaccurates maths that tried to evaluate how unfair orders could be depending on vegetarian people percentage and vegetarian pizza percentage.
But I needed more, I wanted to have a full simulation of people eating slices of pizza depending on their diet, and not only for vegetarians, but for other major diets.
I kept this idea in my head for a long time.
And that's when the second reason appeared.
One day I wanted to learn React.
This was the perfect excuse.
I started working, and I enjoyed it, so I kept making it better and better, until at some point it was good enough to be deployed. So it was the opportunity to see how to deploy a website on the web, so there it is.
I'm still working on it from time to time.
I have a few intersting feature to add.
But if you have a feature idea, or a bug to report. Let me know.
